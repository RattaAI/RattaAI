# RattaAI Agent

**Sniffing Out Alpha Before Anyone Else. AI for Professional Crypto Hunters.**

RattaAI is an advanced, locally deployable AI intelligence agent designed for the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. It empowers professional traders, researchers, and crypto enthusiasts with an edge by providing rapid on-chain analysis, smart money tracking, and Alpha discovery capabilities, all while ensuring maximum data privacy and user control through on-device processing.

## Overview

In the fast-paced and often opaque crypto market, timely and accurate intelligence is paramount. RattaAI aims to democratize access to sophisticated on-chain analytics by delivering a powerful, yet user-friendly desktop application. By running AI models locally, users retain full ownership and control over their data and analytical processes, eliminating reliance on third-party servers for core intelligence generation.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🔒 Local-First AI Processing:** All core data analysis and AI model inference happen directly on your machine. Your sensitive data, API keys, and analytical strategies never leave your local environment.
*   **⚡ Blazing-Fast On-Chain Analysis:** Input a token address, wallet address, or transaction hash and get comprehensive intelligence reports in seconds.
*   **🎯 Alpha Discovery Engine:** Utilizes proprietary AI models to identify emerging trends, unusual activity, and potential high-value opportunities before they become widely known.
*   **🕵️ Smart Money & Whale Tracking:** Monitor the activities of influential wallets, VCs, and protocol treasuries. Get alerts on significant transactions and portfolio changes.
*   **🛡️ Secure & Private by Design:** Built with security and privacy as foundational principles. No centralized data collection for core analytical functions.
*   **📊 Customizable Dashboards & Alerts:** Tailor your intelligence feed with custom dashboards, watchlists, and real-time alerts for events important to you.
*   **🔌 Extensible Plugin Architecture:** An open plugin system will allow the community and third-party developers to extend RattaAI's capabilities, integrate new data sources, and build custom analytical modules.
*   **🔗 Multi-Chain Support:** Initial focus on EVM-compatible chains with plans to expand to other major blockchains.
*   **📈 User-Controlled Intelligence:** You define the parameters, you run the analysis, you own the insights.

## 🚀 Current Status

RattaAI is currently in the Early Development phase. We are actively working on core features, model refinement, and user interface improvements.

**What's working / In Progress:**
*   Core local AI engine setup.
*   Basic address analysis module for Ethereum.
*   Initial UI/UX design mockups.
*   Development of smart contract interaction analysis.

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Preliminary)

**Prerequisites (Tentative):**
*   Operating System: Windows 10/11 (64-bit), macOS Monterey or newer, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ or equivalent).
*   Hardware: Modern CPU (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5, 8th Gen or newer), 16GB RAM, SSD with 50GB free space recommended.

**Installation (Future):**
*   Instructions for building from source will be provided for advanced users.

**Running RattaAI (Future):**
*   Launch the downloaded executable file.

## 💡 How It Works (High-Level Technical Overview)

RattaAI's architecture is centered around a modular, locally-run system:

1.  **Data Connectors:** Securely interface with public blockchain nodes (users can configure their own preferred RPC endpoints) and other public data APIs.
2.  **Local Data Cache & Indexer:** Efficiently stores and indexes relevant blockchain data locally for rapid querying and analysis.
3.  **AI Intelligence Engine:** This is the core, comprising:
    *   **Pre-trained Models:** For tasks like address classification, risk scoring, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition. These models are designed to run efficiently on local hardware.
    *   **Rule-Based System:** Allows for user-defined heuristics and a more deterministic layer of analysis.
    *   **Analysis Pipeline:** Orchestrates data fetching, pre-processing, model inference, and result aggregation.
4.  **User Interface (Desktop App):** Provides an intuitive way to input queries, configure settings, view analysis results, manage watchlists, and receive alerts.
5.  **Plugin Manager:** Will manage the lifecycle and integration of external plugins.
